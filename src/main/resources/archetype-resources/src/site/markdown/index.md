Commons testing
===============

This is a set of utility classes that are used for testing that are not
available in other popular projects such as [JUnit][], [Mockito] or 
[Apache Commons][].

At present this implements [Utility class validation][1] and 
[SSL certificate check bypass][2].

This project also tests the [Java project][3] definition.
